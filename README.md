# self-driving-car
Idea: The game will be a simulation of a self-driving car navigating through different terrains and obstacles. The player's goal is to program the car's AI algorithm to successfully reach the finish line without crashing into any obstacles.

Steps:

Setting up the Environment: Install and import the required libraries and create a window for the game.

Creating the Car and Obstacles: Use Turtle to create a car and various obstacles like rocks, trees, and other vehicles.

Implementing the AI Algorithm: Use Torch to create an AI algorithm for the car that can sense and avoid obstacles. The AI algorithm should be capable of making decisions in real-time based on the car's sensors.

User Interface: Use Tkinter to create a user interface for the game, including start, pause, and stop buttons, and a display showing the car's progress.

Game Mechanics: Use Pygame to add game mechanics, such as sound effects, scoring system, and a timer.

Testing and Debugging: Test the game and debug any issues that arise.

Refinement: Fine-tune the game's difficulty level, graphics, and AI algorithm to make the game more engaging and challenging.

Deployment: Deploy the game and share it with the community.
